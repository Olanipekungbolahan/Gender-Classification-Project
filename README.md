# Machine Learning Model Deployment Project

This project demonstrates the deployment of machine learning models using Flask and Streamlit. It includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Train machine learning models including RandomForest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Neural Network.
   - Perform hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare the performance before and after optimization.

4. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the models using Flask and Streamlit.
   - Access the deployed models via web interfaces.
